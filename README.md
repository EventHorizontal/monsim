# Monsim

At its core, `monsim` is an engine that simulates Pokemon battles. It is meant to be used in a GUI application that allows the user to create, organise and test fanmade Pokemon content - A Pokemon content creator.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Monsim is _not_ a game. You will find that it lacks the features to really play it like a game. It is tuned for content generation. If you want to play Pokemon battles, stick to [Pokemon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/).

## Experimental Software

> [!WARNING]
> For now `monsim` is **alpha software** and it is very much unfinished. It is liable to crash, have broken features and lacks end user usability and documentation.

## Usage

Monsim is meant to be used as a rust library as a simulation engine. It is as of yet unavailable on crates.io, but it can be cloned from this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EventHorizontal/monsim.git
```

and then import it into your project.

A binary is available as well but for now it is really only for testing the library, but eventually it will be used as a content editor to be used with the `monsim` library.
